# Connect entries and repair broken links

This walkthrough uses a registered, writable `test-kb`. For output shapes and
exit-code contracts, see [JSON contracts](json-contracts.md). Linking is an
explicit file change; discovery only proposes candidates.

## Link two entries and find backlinks

```bash
pyrite create -k test-kb -t note --title Alpha --body "Evidence [[missing]]"
pyrite create -k test-kb -t note --title Beta --body "A supported claim"
pyrite link alpha beta -k test-kb --relation supports --bidi
pyrite backlinks beta -k test-kb
```

`--bidi` writes the reverse relationship too. Without it, the forward link
still appears in backlinks; a backlink is derived and does not require a
second written link. In entry bodies, `[[id]]` is a wikilink and `![[id]]`
is a transclusion. A relation's meaning is separate from whether the target
currently exists.

## Check broken targets

Alpha's example body deliberately names a missing entry. The check below
returns its findings and exits1, so handle that exit in `set -e` automation.
Repair the target spelling or create the intended entry; checking itself does
not repair files.

<!-- expect-exit: 1 -->
```bash
pyrite links check -k test-kb
```

## Link many entries

Save this as `links.yaml`. Source and target are required. Quote IDs such as
`"2024"` or `"yes"` so YAML does not turn them into numbers or booleans.

```yaml
- source: alpha
  target: beta
  relation: references
- source: alpha
  relation: supports
```

A dry run shows the plan without changing entries. Each bad specification is
reported independently; the missing target in this example makes both runs
partial, exit3. In the real run, valid specifications are still written.

<!-- expect-exit: 3 -->
```bash
pyrite links bulk-create links.yaml -k test-kb --dry-run
```

<!-- expect-exit: 3 -->
```bash
pyrite links bulk-create links.yaml -k test-kb
```

## Find candidates and one-way links

```bash
pyrite links suggest alpha -k test-kb
pyrite links discover alpha -k test-kb --mode keyword --include-empty
pyrite links batch-suggest --source-kb test-kb --target-kb test-kb --mode keyword --include-empty
pyrite links asymmetric -k test-kb
pyrite links orphans -k test-kb
```

`discover` and `batch-suggest` normally omit entries with neither body nor
summary; `--include-empty` includes them. Suggestions are not automatic links.
Asymmetric links and orphans are review aids, not instructions to add every
possible edge.

## Link across KBs

A body prefix in `[[other-kb:id]]` may be the full KB name or its `shortname`.
A frontmatter link's `kb:` field resolves the same way. Resolution only sees
KBs the reader may read. In CLI options such as `-k` and `--target-kb`, use
full registered names: shortnames are link syntax, not alternate KB names.
See the [KB_NOT_FOUND contract](json-contracts.md#error-shape).

After adding or changing a shortname, run an index build: an incremental sync
does not reread an unchanged source file. `links_stale_kb` in index health
helps identify this condition. For a cross-KB CLI link, pass the source KB with
`-k` and the full destination name with `--target-kb`.
